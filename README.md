# Template for C++ 17 projects with CMake >= 3.5 and Catch2 v3

To test that everything is okay, after cloning step into the directory and execute:

```
cmake -B build
cd build
make test
```

A single test should run and pass. If this does not work, there are probably issues with Catch2 dependencies.
